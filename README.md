# Demo Task to Wildberries Tech School

This project is a demonstration service with a simple frontend interface that displays **order data**.  
It is based on a **Go microservice**, using **Kafka**, **PostgreSQL**, and in-memory caching.

---

##  Description

The service implements the following flow:

1. **Order Data Ingestion**
    - Orders are produced into a Kafka topic.
    - A Go consumer service listens to Kafka, receives order data, and processes it.

2. **Data Storage**
    - Orders are added into a PostgreSQL database. 

3. **In-Memory Cache**
    - Orders are cached in memory for fast access.

4. **Frontend**
    - A minimal frontend
    - It fetches order data from the Go backend.
